;; prime_divisors: compute the prime factorization of a number
;;
;; To test this function, open a new `gsi` instance and then type:
;;  (load "prime_divisors.scm")
;; Then you can issue commands such as:
;;  (prime-divisors 60)
;; And you should see results of the form:
;;  (2 2 3 5)

;; This is a skeleton for the prime-divisors function.  For now, it just
;; returns #f (false)
;;
;; Note that you will almost certainly want to write some helper functions,
;; and also that this will probably need to be a recursive function.  You are
;; not required to use good information hiding.  That is, you may `define`
;; other functions in the global namespace and use them from
;; `prime-divisors`.
