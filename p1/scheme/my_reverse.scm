;; my_reverse: reverse a list without using the scheme `reverse` function
;;
;; Your implementation of this function can use special forms and standard
;; functions, such as `car`, `cdr`, `list`, `append`, and `if`, but it cannot
;; use the built-in `reverse` function.
;;
;; Your implementation should be recursive.
