# tree: A binary tree, implemented as a class
#
# The tree should support the following methods:
# - ins(x)      - Insert the value x into the tree
# - clear()     - Reset the tree to empty
# - inslist(l)  - Insert all the elements from list `l` into the tree
# - display()   - Use `display` to print the tree
# - inorder(f)  - Traverse the tree using an in-order traversal, applying
#                 function `f` to the value in each non-null position
# - preorder(f) - Traverse the tree using a pre-order traversal, applying
#                 function `f` to the value in each non-null position
